              <div class="para">The birth of HotBites began with 2 brothers and a dream, Paul and John Anderson. The Andersons moved from Liverpool, UK, at a young age when their single mother found a job opportunity in Malaysia. Their lives were not well off, but they were appreciative of what they could have. In the late 1990’s, the twins grew up with a mix of food from their home town and the vast variety of flavours and spices from different cultures in Malaysia. Paul and John were particularly fond of the spicy and creamy curry that was made by their favourite vendors, Pak Cik Ali and Mak Cik Roslina. Everyday after school, a bowl of piping hot rice and curries were served. Paul and John would always talk about opening their own restaurant someday. Seeing their love for the dishes, the couple offered cooking lessons and shared their secret recipe to them. Once they had retired, the Andersons took over as the new chefs, and decided to add a special menu to the list that would be marked down in history. With the spices the couple used, they created the signature Hot Chicken Burger which made business blow up better than ever.</div>

              <div class="para">In 2010, they opened up their first and most iconic fast food restaurant, naming it HotBites as a tribute to the couple's curry chicken which they called “Hidangan Pedas” (which means a Spicy Treat in Malay). Business only grew from there as the chains started to reach more than 16 countries worldwide. Customers from all around the world enjoyed the authentic seasoning and notable generously sized portions. From then on, lives were changed, and it all came from a dream that was supported by love and dedication.</div>

              <div>The heart of HotBites beats with a single, clear purpose: to share the love, flavour, and generosity that first brought our dream to life. It began with the simple, delicious promise of a "Hidangan Pedas"—a Spicy Treat—from Pak Cik Ali and Mak Cik Roslina. Our mission, today and always, is to bring that same feeling of warmth and authentic excitement to every customer, in every one of our 16+ countries. We are driven to deliver generously sized portions of unique, quality food that honors the incredible fusion of home-town comfort and Malaysian spice that shaped Paul and John.</div>
